What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

What worked was identifying what methods went into each file. What also worked was figuring out which attributes from the procedural code were no longer needed, such as item id. What didn't work was trying to put the computer's information in the inventory in the reslae shop, so I had to result to inefficient ways. What also worked was my main procedure, showing accurate results, but whenever I ran it (or even had different names for different files) it ran the procedure specifics from both files. I would advise you to go to TA hours, or working with the person next to you in class for at least one houre. Teamwork shows alternative methods, and TA's help you understand basic coding aspects/alternatives you may not have thought of. Do not rush to code either, think about it.
